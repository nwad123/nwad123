# Hello there! 👋

I'm Nick, a computer engineer interested in programming languages, formal verification, and
computer architectures.

## Schooling 📚

I'm currently studying computer engineering 🖥️ at [Utah State University](https://www.usu.edu/) and
expect to complete my Master's Degree in 2025.

## Coding Experience 🧑‍💻

I currently am most experienced writing C and C++, but I've taken courses using Rust and Java, 
and I'm familiar with MATLAB, Python, VHDL, and Verilog. I'm
interested in learning Swift, and also interested in trying out / contributing to unique hardware
description languages like [chisel](https://www.chisel-lang.org/) and [spade](https://spade-lang.org/).
