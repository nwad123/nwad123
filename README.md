# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nick, a computer engineer interested in programming languages, formal verification, and
digital architectures.

My favorite language currently is C++, and my favorite current feature is `constexpr`. I'm
interested in learning Swift, and also looking for ideas to make a microcontroller
specific language.

I'm studying computer engineering at Utah State University and expect to complete my Master's
Degree in 2025.
